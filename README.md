# Human-Computer-interaction
A health tracker system that could record and track health condition for user. Finished by HTML, css and Javascript.


->Program starts by index.html from where we can navigate to any other html files. Users also have freedom to get out of the webpage by signing out under settings. Settings also has dark-mode and eye care mode which can be used by clicking the check box. Search bar is just a prototype. If you write something and click the search icon it will show that it is not responsive.

Open the website in full screen to get a better view.

Input box on the sleep.html page allows the user to input the time got in bed and woke up, using the clock icon to input easily. 

The line chart data is faked by random within a reasonable range.  

In the workout.html page, after user input the time “workout finished in minutes” and “workout for today”, the “left to goal” section will automatically be calculated. The pie chart will automatically be shown. This implies to all pages with the same functions.
